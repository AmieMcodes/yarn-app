# Yarn App — Human‑Centered Automation Demo

This project is a **real‑world example of how I design systems around people, not just features**.

Yarn App demonstrates how everyday users can track information, reduce mental load, and make better decisions through **thoughtful automation and clean UX** — without needing to “learn software.”

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This is **not** a hobby app and **not** a yarn tutorial.

It is a **user‑focused tracking system** that shows how I:

* Turn messy, real‑life information into calm, structured workflows
* Design interfaces that feel intuitive to non‑technical users
* Add automation where it actually helps (not where it looks clever)
* Build tools people *want* to use consistently

The domain happens to be crafting, but the **patterns apply to any business or workflow**:

* inventory tracking
* project management
* usage monitoring
* habit systems
* internal tools

## 👩‍💻 Why I Built It

Many apps fail not because the tech is bad — but because **they ignore how humans actually think and behave**.

This project focuses on:

* reducing friction
* surfacing the *right* information at the *right* moment
* designing for real people with limited time and attention

This same approach is what I bring to:

* internal business dashboards
* customer‑facing portals
* AI‑assisted workflows
* operational tools that need trust and clarity

---

## 🧩 Key Capabilities

* User authentication and gated routes
* Structured data entry with validation
* Real‑time state updates
* Dashboard‑style summaries (not raw data dumps)
* Clean separation between UI, logic, and data services
* Designed to scale into automation and AI assistance

---

## 🛠️ Technical Overview (Brief)

* Frontend: React + Vite
* Styling: Tailwind CSS
* Backend services: Firebase
* Architecture: modular, production‑ready structure

> The full application lives inside the `/web` directory.

## 💬 The Bigger Picture

This repo exists to show **how I think**, not just what I can code.

My strength is building:

> systems that quietly make life easier —
> without users needing to understand how they work.

If you're looking for someone who builds **usable, human‑first software**, this project shows exactly how I approach that work.
